I'm a research intern in the [Quantitative Biomedical Research Center](https://qbrc.swmed.edu/) at UT Southwestern Medical Center. I also work as a research assistant in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.utdallas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Dallas. This fall, I will start my PhD with the [Interdepartmental Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics](https://cbb.yale.edu/), which is part of the [Combined Program in the Biological and Biomedical Sciences](https://medicine.yale.edu/bbs/) at Yale University.

As a budding biomedical informatician, my academic interests are diverse and include deep learning, natural language processing, and wearable devices, particularly as applied to problems in psychiatry. Broadly construed, biomedical informatics refers to the computational analysis and statistical interpretation of biological and clinical data on high-performance computing platforms. My prior research experience spans cancer biophysics, molecular radiation oncology, microfluidic single-cell analysis, statistical shape analysis, and electronic health record analysis.

I was born and partially raised in Dallas, TX but spent much of my childhood in Beijing, China. I returned to Dallas to finish high school and left for Baltimore, MD for my undergraduate work, completing a B.S. in molecular and cellular biology at Johns Hopkins University (Class of 2020). I returned to Dallas once again and underwent a career transition from pre-med to biomedical informatics, taking courses and conducting full-time research at the University of Texas at Dallas and UT Southwestern Medical Center. After three years at home, I will start the next phase of my journey as a graduate student in New Haven, CT.

Outside of academia, I am also passionately interested in international relations (particularly East Asian geopolitics), military history, and investigative journalism. My favorite news/opinion publications are [*The Economist*](https://www.economist.com/), [*The New Yorker*](https://newyorker.com/), [*Reuters*](https://reuters.com/), [*The Associated Press*](https://apnews.com/), [*BBC News*](https://bbc.co.uk/news), [*The New York Times*](https://nytimes.com/), [*Bloomberg*](https://bloomberg.com/), [*The Washington Post*](https://washingtonpost.com/), [*The Atlantic*](https://theatlantic.com/), [*NPR*](https://npr.org/), and [*Nikkei Asia*](https://asia.nikkei.com). I also follow the work of the [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/), the [Carnegie Endowment for International Peace](https://carnegieendowment.org/), and the [Center for Strategic and International Studies](https://www.csis.org/).

Ways that I add flavor to my life include reading a truly inordinate amount of news and Wikipedia, writing both fiction and non-fiction, studying languages (mostly Japanese), constantly trying new recipes, playing video games, and [practicing kendo](https://yalekendo.sites.yale.edu/).
